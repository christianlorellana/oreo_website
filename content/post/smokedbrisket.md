## Description

We made our own rub and au jus sauce for this one. Smoked on the grill for 3 hours, covered on aluminum pan for 8 hours total at 300F since it was a 21LBS brisket. Once the point reached 205F we took it out and wrapped it in a blanket for an additional two hours. Separated the point and flat, and rubbed under the point then placed back on the grill for one hour for more burnt ends while we enjoyed the flat with au jus sauce.

Just delivered!
