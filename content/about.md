description: Who is Oreo?
---

The nickname was given one hot summer afternoon while in Marine Corps bootcamp. It was lunch time and the drill instructors inspected everyone prior to entering the chow hall, when it was my turn, he stumbled trying to pronounce my last name "Orellana" for a few seconds. He got mad and look at my face and screamed: "Your face looks like a pizza, no! It's round like an Oreo!" Ever since that moment I was known as "Oreo". The name Christian just became a family name until I met my wife 5 years into my service in the Marine Corps.

I am a husband to the most wonderful and wildest woman (Nicole) I have ever met, and we been married for a decade and counting. I am also a father to Caleb (8) and Chase (5), and a stepfather to Chloe (14). They all mean the world to me.

I was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in San Pedro Sula, Honduras for 15 years. Finished Junior and Senior years at Truman High school with the help of my cousin and his wife which gave me a home until I left for Marines Corps bootcamp. Spent the next year in training to become a Tactical Data Systems Administrator (5974), and two years in Okinawa, Japan. 

My favorite hobbies are hanging out with my kids and family, playing video games, trading financial markets and buying Bitcoin, watching the Kansas City Chiefs, and tinkering with hardware and software. As far as video games go, I have been playing Overwatch on PC for many years now, and currently playing Outrider with my closest friend. Became deeply passionate about learning everything I could about money and the world economy, and I have finally settled on selling options derivatives contracts on all markets for extra income and accumulating as much Bitcoin as I can. 

When I was a child, my Grandfather gifted me a small FM/AM radio to enjoy listening to, but my curiosity for taking things apart to find out how the worked was overwhelming. Discovering the guts of that radio sparked my passion for electronics, computers, and the Internet. I would spend most of my afternoons at many Internet Cafe's browsing forums, chatting on the messenger, and learning anything I could through search engines for hours or until I ran out of money.

Thanks for reading this little bit of me!
