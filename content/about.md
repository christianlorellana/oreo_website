description: Who is Oreo?
---

The nickname was given one hot summer afternoon while in Marine Corps bootcamp. It was lunch time and the drill instructors inspected everyone prior to entering the chow hall, when it was my turn, he stumbled trying to pronounce my last name "Orellana" for a few seconds. He got mad and look at my face and screamed: "Your face looks like a pizza, no! It's round like an Oreo!" Ever since that moment I was known as "Oreo". The name Christian just became a family name until I met my wife 5 years into my service in the Marine Corps.

I was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in San Pedro Sula, Honduras for 15 years. Finished Junior and Senior years at Truman High school with the help of my cousin and his wife which gave me a home until I left for Marines Corps bootcamp after graduation and spent the next year in training to become a Tactical Data Systems Administrator (5974). 

I am a husband to the most wonderful and wildest woman (Nicole) I have ever met, and we been married for a decade and counting. I am also a father to Caleb (8) and Chase (5), and a stepfather to Chloe (14). They all mean the world to me.

My favorite hobbies are hanging out with my kids and family, playing video games, trading financial derivatives markets and Bitcoin, and tinkering with hardware and software. As far as video games go, I have been playing Overwatch on PC for many years now, and currently playing Outrider with my friend. Became deeply passionate about learning everything I could about money and the world economy, and I have finally settled on selling options contracts on all markets for extra income, and accumulating as much Bitcoin as I can. 

Thanks for reading this little bit of me!
