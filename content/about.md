description: Who is Oreo?
---

The nickname was given one hot summer afternoon while in Marine Corps bootcamp. It was lunch time and the drill instructors inspected everyone prior to entering the chow hall, when it was my turn he could not pronounce my last name "Orellana" and stumple for a few seconds. He got mad and look at my face and screamed: "Your face looks like a pizza, no! It's round like and Oreo!" Ever since that moment I was known as "Oreo". The name Christian just became a family name until I met my wife 4 years into my service in the Marine Corps.

I am a husband to the most wonderful and wildest woman (Nicole) i've ever met, and we been married for a decade and counting. I am also a father to Caleb (8) and Chase (5), and a step-father to Chloe(14). They all mean the world to me.

Besides hanging out with my kids and family, my favorite hobbies are playing video games and trading financial markets. Been playing Overwatch on PC ever since it launched, and currently playing Outrider with friend.

Thanks for reading this little bit of me!
