description: Who is Oreo?
---

The nickname was given one hot summer afternoon while in Marine Corp bootcamp. while waiting outside the chowhall the drill instructors went around inspecting every Marine, and when it was my turn he could not pronounce my last name "Orellana". He got mad and look at my face and said: "Your face is like a pizza, no, it's round like and Oreo", and ever since my bootcamp friends called me "Oreo". The name Christian was just became a family name.

I am a husband to the most wonderful and wildest woman (Nicole) i've ever met, and have been married for a decade and conting. I am also a father to Caleb (8) and Chase (5), and a step-father to Chloe(14). They all mean the world to me.

Thanks for reading this little  bit of me!
